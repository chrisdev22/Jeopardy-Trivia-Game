# Jeopardy-Trivia-Game

This is the official Jeoapardy Trivia Game! It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The game itself is a data structured and algorithms per question sequences that result in adding points for each player that joins the trivia game.
If the player loses it will stop and a pop-up message will appear stating the points and the player's high score.
It's a fun game for the whole family!!!
Thank you,
Chris
